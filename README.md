HUMAN RESOURCE ATTRITION DATA ANALYSIS USING TABLEAU
Attrition in human resources refers to the gradual loss of employees over time. In general, relatively high attrition is problematic for companies. HR professionals often assume a leadership role in designing company compensation programs, work culture and motivation systems that help the organization retain top employees. A major problem in high employee attrition is its cost to an organization. Job postings, hiring processes, paperwork and new hire training are some of the common expenses of losing employees and replacing them. Additionally, regular employee turnover prohibits an organization from increasing its collective knowledge base and experience over time. This is especially concerning if the business is customer facing, as customers often prefer to interact with familiar people. Errors and issues are more likely if the organization has constantly new workers.
Retaining the employees involves understanding the intrinsic motivators as individuals differ a lot. Retaining employees is a critical and ongoing effort. Staff requires reinforcement, direction and recognition to grow and remain satisfied in their positions. Managers must recognize this and understand that establishing such fundamentals demonstrates their objectives to support nature and motivate their employees. This study is an outcome of the topic called “A Study on Attrition Management”. This research is an attempt to find out the causes of attrition from different dimensions and have proposed some ways in which this issue can be addressed.
